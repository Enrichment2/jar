# Jar

A simple, local-first notes app. Your ideas in a jar.

## Version 0.1.0

This is the bare minimum. It does three things:
1. Add a note
2. Edit a note (tap it)
3. Delete a note (long press)

That's it. No cloud. No account. No tracking. Just notes, stored on your device.

## Building

1. Open this project in Android Studio (Arctic Fox or newer)
2. Let Gradle sync
3. Run on your device or emulator

Built with frustration, simplified with force.
